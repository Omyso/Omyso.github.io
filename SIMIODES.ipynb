The problem statement can be found below, but the general goal was to create a physics-based differential equation model that could properly determine the ideal moment to perform a [bike throw](<https://www.bicycling.com/training/a20017965/how-to-outsprint-the-competition-with-a-bike-throw/>) in a race. The video above describes our approach for creating the differential equation as well at the answer to the questions posed in the problem statement.\n",
