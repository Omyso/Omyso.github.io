A little about me, I am a junior at UC Berkeley majoring in Data Science. A couple of my hobbies are video games and going rock climbing. Currently I'm also a software Engineering Intern at Rimble, a startup which is a company in the esports industry. Next summer I will be interning at Hewlett Packard Enterprise. If you're interested in some of my other experiences here is my LinkedIn: <https://www.linkedin.com/in/omysorewala/>.
